Guide for better sound quality for music in Zoom video calls
============================================================

This guide is hosted as web pages at http://et√§tunnit.taiteilijat.fi/.

During the Corona virus restrictions of 2020,
music instructors in Finland shared experiences of different video call apps.
These web pages were created to provide illustrated instructions
for setting up better quality video calls for music instrument lessons
using the Zoop video conferencing application.

All help is appreciated regarding e.g.

- verifying the guide to be accurate
- additions to the guide (e.g. Mac screenshots, instructions in English etc.)
- corrections to instructions and screenshots
- usability and visual style improvements
- HTML/CSS code quality improvements
- etc.
